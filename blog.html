                <h3>Wireframe to HTML</h3>
                <p>Website Update #2: This past week I have transitioned from a physical wireframe of my website to digital. The basic structure of the pages have been written up and I am ready to start integrating the stylesheets for color themes and fonts. For this next week, I plan to continue documenting my progress on the website as a case study and put together additional graphics for the project development timeline. I have also been researching what companies are looking for in front-end web developers and found that there are a couple of different tools that I would like to familiarize myself with. These tools include bootstrap, sketch, adobe xd, balsamiq mockups and industrial art for user experience design.</p>

                <h3>Integrate Stylesheets</h3>
                <p>Website Update #3: This past week I have  integrated the stylesheets for color themes and fonts.  My color theme is dark green with white backgrounds where body of texts will lay. My font is typewriter for the body and uppercase  thin font for headings. I'm still playing around with the font sizes but it will most likely be 12pt for body and I will use varying sizes for the headings depending on the context. For this next week, I plan to work on my logo and configuring the navigation that connects each page. I am planning on updating my resume to make available on my website as well.</p>

                <h3>Logo Design and Navigation</h3>
                <p>Website Update #4: This past week I have been working on my logo and configuring the navigation that connects each page. I have updated my resume and will be making that part of my website as well. For the next two weeks, I am planning on organizing personal projects and continue to test the website so that it continues to be responsive with the content. I was hoping to make my logo animated but realistically I've had to push that back for now  and just keep things static. I am also going to be compiling the website's timeline as a GIF to make sure I have some media representations present. </p>

                <p>Website Update #5: This past week I have finished some navigation and logo configurations. I have updated my resume and will also be linking a printable version. For these last two weeks I plan on adding personal projects, and testing the responsiveness of the website. I will be uploading the content to a hosting website and continue making adjustments. I am most worried about how graphics load so I'm also going to make changes to media sizes before posting  instead of having the browser render the sizes. </p>
